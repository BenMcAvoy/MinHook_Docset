# Information
This project uses [Dashing generator](https://github.com/technosophos/dashing) to generate Dash/Zeal/etc documentation.
It's based on the [Dashing example for BusyBox](https://github.com/technosophos/dashing/tree/master/examples/busybox) and uses documentation in the [MinHook.h header file](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook/blob/master/include/MinHook.h).
